	I went to high park to see the cherry blossoms with my engineering buddys today. I'll probably edit the vlog 
	I made about that and post it on youtube. I set up tabs for my site. I realized that I probably shouldn't be 
	typing my blog directly in the index.html file. Anyways here a picture of us at high park.
