What is going on, It's John<br>
Presently hacking Zeul's site<br>
Except not really cause he legit gave me his password (I created a DMZ and set up remote SSH)<br>
This server is highly insecure tho<br>
Chances are<br>
This will be a member of a botnet before the year is through<br>
Zeul's Pi is gonna get pwned<br>
