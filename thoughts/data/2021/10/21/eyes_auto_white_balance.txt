Eyes Auto White Balance

I know that it takes something like 16 minutes for our eyes to fully adjust from lightness 
to darkness (which uncoincidentally is the same time that it takes for the sun to set).
I think that each of our three color cones in a our eyes must independently adapt to luminosity,
which leads to our eyes doing a sort of 
"<a href="https://youtu.be/fINr3OGhqd8?t=20"><font color="#1187FC">auto white balancing</font></a>." 
This is why we don't really notice the difference in the temperature of our 3500k lights at night, 
and the sunlight. There's this "what's it like to be color blind test" where you expose a single eye to
a lot of a single color, then after a while you compare your eyes vision by opening and closing a single eye
and you notice that the eye that was stimulated now sees a lot less of that color.
