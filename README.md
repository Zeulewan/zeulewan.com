This repo contains all the data for my website. 
The only thing needed to run this is apache and php. 
If you have those installed you can just drop this into your html file and make sure all necessary permissions are given and it should run.
This site is still a work in progress and definitely does not run as efficiently as it could.
That being said, my goal of having to put little to no formatting in the actual blog post files is complete, see for yourself under blog/data/year/month/day/day.txt
