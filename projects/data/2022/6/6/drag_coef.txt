Calculating the Drag coefficient

Started using OpenRocket to simulate launches. 
Very exited about this software!

I'm going to try to replicate the results by hand with equations. 
I could save a lot of time by taking the drag coefficient from the software.
It'd be a hard thing to experientially calculate myself. It'd involve doing a bunch of launches,
getting an accelerometer, an altimeter and a clock that all sync up, and even doing some calculus.

To find the drag coefficient you need:<br> <br> 

1. Drag force<br> 
2. Mass density of the fluid<br>
3. Flow speed of the object relative to the fluid<br>
4. Reference area<br>
<br>


The speed after engine burn <s>(which I could just approximate using a video)</s>, and the apogee altitude would tell me how much work was done
by air resistance (That is if I calculate how high it would have gone neglecting air resistance, and compare).
Given the work done I could calculate the average force on it, which would give me an approximation. 
I could also just use the accelerometer to see how fast it is decelerating, factor out gravity, use the mass of the rocket and there I go I got the drag force.
<br><br>
The mass density of the fluid is the the density of air, the flow speed is
just going to be how fast the rocket is going (which is why I should try to measure the speed of the rocket close to the ground), and the reference area is 
just the cross-sectional area which I'm actually not sure how to calculate. I don't know if it's an average, or just the area of the widest part of the rocket or somthing.
